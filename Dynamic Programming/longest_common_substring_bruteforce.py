'''
This is a naive solution which finds all the substrings (substring starts at either element) of the two given strings and 
discovers the longest common substrings between the two

If the strings have a matching character, we recursively check for the remaining length of each and keep a track of the current matching length.

If the characters donâ€™t match, we start two new recursive calls by skipping those characters from each string.

The length of the longest common substring will be the maximum number returned by the three recursive calls
