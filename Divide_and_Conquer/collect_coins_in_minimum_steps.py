'''
The for loop in the initial call requires O(n)effort. Subsequently, recursive calls are made to the function, where the for loop runs roughly n/2 steps in each call. 
In the worst case, the number of times the call is repeated depends on the height of the highest stack of coins. So, the complexity should be O(n*highest_height_of_stack)
