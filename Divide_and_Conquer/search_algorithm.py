Time complexity
If we start at the middle of the list, itâ€™s either we are lucky and the element matches or we discard half of the list. 
In the worst case, we will repeatedly discard half of the sublists from the previous step until the list can no longer be subdivided, 
i.e., it is of size 1. An array of size n can be divided into halves lg n times until we reach a sublist of size 1. 
Hence, the time complexity of this solution of finding an element in a sorted list is O(lg n)
