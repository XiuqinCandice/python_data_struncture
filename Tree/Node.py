'''
To implement a BST, the first thing youâ€™d need is a node. 
A node should have a value, a left child, a right child, and a parent. 
This node can be implemented as a Python class and here is the code.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):  # Constructor to initialize the value of the node
        self.val = val
        self.leftChild = None  # Sets the left and right children to `None`
        self.rightChild = None

        current = self
        parent = None

            parent = current
